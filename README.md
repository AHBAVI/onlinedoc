This project to find our education documents from one single word.

>----Problem-----<

In sri lanka we use books for our education also if we need to finid a formular related to our subject we have to refer lot of pages to find it.

for this problem i made a simple web system.

In this  system there are sft(science for technology),et(enineering for technology),ict and fomular categories.

In each category showing subject related details to each topic only we have to do is put out search word to the search box.
after that system will bring all related results to the that word.

Also in formular category there are formulars related to sft and et subjects.

For best view.view the website from this link.
